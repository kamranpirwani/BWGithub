/**
 * @class BWGithubMockProvider
 * @brief The responsibility of this class is to mimic the behavior the real github provider would give us
 *        and provide us with mock responses, generated from json files of the actual api responses
 * @note This is particularly beneficial in the scenario where we don't want to perform the network requests,
 *       and want to quickly test the UI. Additionally, it can help in the event we get rate limited with their API
