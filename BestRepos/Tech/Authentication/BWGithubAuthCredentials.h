 * @class BWGithubAuthCredentials
 * @brief The purpose of this class is to provide a wrapper around our
 *        GitHub credentials and retrive them from a file on disk. This allows us to
 *        get around hardcoding our details into the client, and gives us the ability to 
 *        modify our credentials without having to recompile the app
